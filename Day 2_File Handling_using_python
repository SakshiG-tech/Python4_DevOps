The Code for file handling:

file = open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','r')
with open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','w') as file:
  file.write("Python is a Human understandable language \n which makes it easy to read and write line by line")
with open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','a') as file:
  file.write("\nAppend mode will make changes without overwriting the original content")
content = file.read()
print(content)    
file.close()

****************OPENING A FILE : 
use open('') function to opena file. Specify the file name & mode (e.g. 'r' for read, 'w' for write,'a' for append)
file = open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','r')


*****************READING FROM A FILE : 
read the content of the file using methods like read(), readline() or readlines()
content = file.read()          #read the entire content of the file
print(content)

line = file.readline()         #read the first line
print(line)

multiline = file.readlines()   #reads multiple lines of a content in a single line/para
print(multiline)


******************WRITE TO A FILE : 
open a file in write mode and use methods like 'write() to add the content.write mode will overwrite the existing content.

content = file.read()
file = open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','w') 
print(content)
        or
content = file.read()
with open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','w') as file:
    file.write("Python is a Human understandable language \n which makes it easy to read and write line by line")
print(content)


*****************APPENDING TO A FILE : Open the file in append mode without overwriting the exisiting content
content = file.read()
file = open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','a')
print(content)
        or
content = file.read()
with open('File_Handling_data_File.txt','a') as file:
    #file.write("\nAppend mode will make changes without overwriting the original content")
print(content)


Note :  Make sure to close the file once the operation on the file are done using
file.close()
